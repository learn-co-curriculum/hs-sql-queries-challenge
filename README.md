## Let's get ready to query!!!

You should already be connected up to the shared Chinook database for a small music store - like iTunes. Now fork and clone this lab and write out the SQL statements in `queries.sql` to fulfill each of these queries:

**1.** Pull a list of all of genres from the database.

**2.** Pull all of the tracks.

**3.** How about just the tracks where the composer is AC/DC?

**4.** Pull all of the tracks greater than 3 minutes long. Hint: You’ll need to figure out how many milliseconds are in a minute.

**5.** Find the top 5 longest tracks. **Hint:** Look up how to use ORDER BY and ASC and DESC [here](http://www.korenlc.com/sql-cheat-sheet/)

**6.** Find the top 5 shortest tracks.

**Take a look at the customer table.**

**7.** How many customers live in Brazil?

**8.** How many customers have gmail accounts? **Hint:** Look up how to use LIKE [here](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/sql/)

**9.** What’s the name of the customer who lives at “3 Chatham Street”?

**10.** Which artist created the album “Ace of Spades”?

**11.** How many albums does Nirvana have?


**Bonus challenge:** 

+ Use joins to find answers to the last two questions by only writing one query.
  * Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia4eCxPPc_o) to learn about joining up tables.
  * And take a look at this cheatsheet for an example of a [join query](http://www.cheatography.com/guslong/cheat-sheets/essential-mysql/).
